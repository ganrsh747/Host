Bluehost is a widely recognized name in the web hosting industry, particularly known for its user-friendly interface and strong integration with WordPress. This makes it a suitable option if you plan to use WordPress for your sports analysis website.

### Ease of Use:
Bluehost offers a very intuitive control panel, particularly its custom dashboard. Installing WordPress is extremely simple with their one-click installation. This makes it easy for beginners to set up their sports analysis website without extensive technical knowledge. They also offer 24/7 support to assist with any issues you might encounter.

### Performance and Speed:
Bluehost utilizes SSD storage, which contributes to faster loading times for your website. While not the absolute fastest on the market, their performance is generally reliable for standard sports analysis websites. Consider their higher-tier plans for increased processing power and resource allocation if your site experiences high traffic or requires more demanding processing.

### Key Features:
Bluehost provides a free domain name for the first year, which is a nice bonus for new website owners. They offer unmetered bandwidth on most plans, allowing for plenty of traffic without worrying about exceeding limits. Security features such as free SSL certificates and CodeGuard Basic backups ensure the safety and integrity of your data.

### Scalability:
Bluehost provides various hosting options, including shared hosting, VPS hosting, and dedicated servers. This allows you to upgrade your hosting plan as your website grows and requires more resources. For a growing sports analysis website, scaling to a VPS or dedicated server may be necessary to handle increased traffic and data processing demands.

### Pricing:
Bluehost's basic shared hosting plan starts at around $2.95 per month, but this is usually a promotional price that increases upon renewal. Their higher-tier plans offer more features and resources but come at a higher cost. Consider the long-term renewal costs when selecting a plan.
